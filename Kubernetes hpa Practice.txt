Horizontal Pod AutoScaling
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Creating nginx deployment with horizontal pod autoscaling Feature
-----------------------------------------------------
1. Enable the metrics-server in minkube cluster using the following command.
2. minikube addons enable metrics-server

3. First create a deployment yaml file with nano nginx-deployment.yml command.
4. Paste following yml inside the file.
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: nginx-deployment
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: nginx
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: nginx
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: nginx
        image: nginx
        resources:
          limits:
            cpu: "500m"
          requests:
            cpu: "200m"

5. Create a horizontal pod autoscaling (HPA) yaml file with nano nginx-hpa.yml command
6. Paste following yml script inside it.
7.
apiVersion: autoscaling/v1
kind: HorizontalPodAutoscaler
metadata:
  name: nginx-hpa
spec:
  scaleTargetRef:
    apiVersion: apps/v1
    kind: Deployment
    name: nginx-deployment
  minReplicas: 1
  maxReplicas: 10
  targetCPUUtilizationPercentage: 10

8. Create a service yaml file with nano nginx-service.yml
9.
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: nginx-service
spec:
  selector:
    app: nginx
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 80
      targetPort: 80
10. Run the three yaml files using following three commands for creating deployment, hpa and services.
11. kubectl apply -f nginx-deployment.yml
12. kubectl apply -f nginx-hpa.yml
13. kubectl apply -f nginx-service.yml
14. View the created deployment, service and hpa using following commands.
15. kubectl get deployments
16. kubectl get services
17. kubectl get hpa

Testing above nginx deployment with Load Generator
-----------------------------------------------------
1. Open 2nd terminal and run following command.
2. kubectl run -i load-generator --rm --image=busybox --restart=Never -- /bin/busybox sh -c "while true; do wget -q -O- http://nginx-service/; done"
3. The above command creates a pod load-generator using busybox image and runs a shell command with a loop that continuously sends HTTP requests to the service http://nginx-service/ created above.
4. In the 1st terminal, run the following to view the number of pods running.
5. kubectl get hpa nginx-hpa --watch
6. You should see that with increase in load, the number of pods will increase.
7. Use Ctrl+C to stop the pod in 2nd terminal and delete it with the following command.
8. kubectl delete pod load-generator
9. Run kubectl get pods command to verify that the pods is deleted.
9. In the 1st terminal, after a while, the number of pods will reduce back to 1 with a decrease in load.

Rollout and Rollback
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Testing Rollout Feature in Kubernetes
-----------------------------------------------------
1. First, create a file using nano rollout.yml with nginx image and paste service and deployment yaml inside it.
2.
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: rollout
  labels:
    app: nginx
spec:
  type: LoadBalancer
  ports:
  - port: 80
  selector:
    app: rollout
---
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: rollout
spec:
  replicas: 2
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: rollout
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: rollout
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: nginx
        image: nginx:latest
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
3. Deploy deployment and service files  using following command
4. kubectl apply -f rollout.yml
5. Run the following commands to check that all pods are running.
6. kubectl get deployments
7. Run the following command to view the rollout history
8. kubectl rollout history deployment rollout
9. Run the following command to annotate the change-cause column.
10. kubectl annotate deployment rollout kubernetes.io/change-cause="nginx:latest deployment"
11. Again run the command provided in step 8 to view the rollout history. You should see the status annotated to the one set in step 10.
12. Next edit the rollout.yml created in step 2 with container image of "httpd:latest" and save it.
13. Run the following commands to update the deployment.
14. kubectl apply -f rollout.yml
15. Run the following command to view the rollout history
16. kubectl rollout history deployment rollout
17. Now, you should see that there are two versions of the deployments, first one with nginx deployment and second with httpd deployment.
18. Run the following command to annotate the change-cause column.
19. kubectl annotate deployment rollout kubernetes.io/change-cause="httpd:latest deployment"
20. Run the command provided in step 16 to view the rollout history. You should see the status annotated to the one set in step 19.
21. Run minikube service rollout command given below to get the url and verfiy httpd server is running.
22. minikube service rollout --url

Testing Rollback Feature in Kubernetes
-----------------------------------------------------
1. Run the following command to rollback to the nginx deployment.
2. kubectl rollout undo deployment rollout.
3. Run the following command to view the rollout history
4. kubectl rollout history deployment rollout
5. It should add revision in the history with ID 3 and remove revision 1 from the history 
6. View the url of the service again to find out that deployment has successfully rolled out to nginx deployment.
7. In the similar way, if there are more than 6 deployments rolled out and you want to rollback to 4th revision, then use following command.
8. kubectl rollout undo deployment --to-revision=4  
9. Create different images of yourproject with varied features and try rollout and rollback features for your own application.
